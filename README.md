# Business Case on Kerang Solar Farm & Battery Storage System Project

**Overview**<br />
This project involves designing and planning a renewable energy solution for Victoria, Australia. The Kerang Solar Farm and Battery Storage System aims to enhance energy stability and affordability by constructing a 100 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) farm and a 50 MW battery energy storage system (BESS).

**Key Objectives**
- Develop a reliable and sustainable energy source for over 37,000 homes
- Contribute to Victoria's renewable energy goals by 2030
- Create local economic opportunities and support the transition to clean energy

**Key Components**
- 100 MW Solar Farm: Harnesses solar energy to generate electricity
- 50 MW Battery Storage: Provides backup power and supports energy stability
- Site Development: Includes access roads and site facilities

**Project Scope**<br />
The project covers the design, approvals, and construction phases, with a focus on sustainability and compliance with local environmental standards.

**Timeline**<br />
The estimated timeline for the project is approximately 137 weeks, including design, construction, and validation phases.

**Budget**<br />
The estimated budget is between AUD 100-127.5 million, covering all phases from planning to construction and validation.

**Stakeholders**<br />
Key stakeholders include government bodies, local councils, environmental groups, and the local community.

**ESG Considerations**<br />
The project prioritizes environmental sustainability, following ISO standards for environmental management and social responsibility.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:
- Project Planning and Management
    - Timeline development ([gantt chart](url), critical path)
    - Financial planning (top-down and bottom-up costs, budget)
    - Calculation of cash flows and NPVs'
    - Stakeholder engagement (power-interest chart)
    - Task identification (work breakdown structure)
- Environmental Considerations
    - Implementation of UN SDGs' to ensure sustainability
    - Adherence to ISO standards to ensure compliance with environmental regulations
- Presentation
    - Preparation and delivery of multiple types of presentations such as oral, roundtable, and video 
- Collaboration and Teamwork
    - Working effectively with a team to achieve project objectives
    - Maintaining clear and consistent communication between team members to ensure alignment, resolve issues, and keep the project on track
## Summary
This project aims to provide us (students) with an understanding of how to develop an engineering project report. This includes learning key aspects such as preliminary assessments and project proposal, in-detailed project planning, time and cost estimation methodologies, risk assessment, and sustainability considerations. The project simulates a real-world engineering environment, enabling us (students) to gain hands-on experience in managing different phases of a project, from conception to completion, while ensuring alignment with industry standards and best practices.
