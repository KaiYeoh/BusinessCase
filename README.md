# Business Case on Kerang Solar Farm & Battery Storage System Project
## Overview
This project aims to provide us (students) with an understanding of how to develop an engineering project report. This includes learning key aspects such as preliminary assessments and project proposal, in-detailed project planning, time and cost estimation methodologies, risk assessment, and sustainability considerations. The project simulates a real-world engineering environment, enabling us (students) to gain hands-on experience in managing different phases of a project, from conception to completion, while ensuring alignment with industry standards and best practices.

## Learning Outcomes
Through the Kerang Solar Farm and Battery Storage System project, I have acquired experience in several critical areas of engineering and project management:
- Project Planning and Management
    - Developed detailed project timelines, utilizing tools such as Gantt charts and Critical path analysis
    - Conducted comprehensive financial planning, including top-down and bottom-up cost estimation and budget allocation
    - Calculated cash flows and Net Present Values (NPVs) to assess project feasibility
    - Engaged stakeholders effectively by employing tools such as the Power-Interest (PI) Chart to manage and prioritize stakeholder needs
    - Identified tasks and organized work through the development of a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Environmental Consideration
    - Implemented principles aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) to ensure project sustainability
    - Ensured adherence to ISO standards to maintain compliance with environmental regulations and best practices
- Presentation
    - Prepared and delivered various types of presentations, including oral, roundtable, and video formats, to communicate the project to different audiences
- Collaboration and Teamwork
    - Worked efficiently within a team to achieve project objectives and deliver results within the designated time frame
    - Maintained clear and consistent communication between team members to ensure alignment, effectively resolve challenges, and keep the projec on track.


## Project Summary
The Kerang Solar Farm and Battery Storage System project is designed to enhance energy stability in Victoria, Australia, through the construction of a 100 MW solar photovoltaic farm and a 50 MW battery energy storage system. This project aligns with Victoria's renewable energy targets and is expected to provide clean energy to over 37,000 homes, while contributing to local economic development.

The scope of the project encompasses the complete design, approval, and construction phases, with an estimated duration of 137 weeks. The budget for this initiative is projected between AUD 100 and 127.5 million. A strong emphasis is placed on sustainability, regulatory compliance, and proactive stakeholder engagement to ensure a successful outcome.
