# Business Case on Kerang Solar Farm & Battery Storage System Project

**Overview**
This project involves designing and planning a renewable energy solution for Victoria, Australia. The Kerang Solar Farm and Battery Storage System aims to enhance energy stability and affordability by constructing a 100 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) farm and a 50 MW battery energy storage system (BESS).

**Key Objectives**
- Develop a reliable and sustainable energy source for over 37,000 homes
- Contribute to Victoria's renewable energy goals by 2030
- Create local economic opportunities and support the transition to clean energy

**Key Components**
- 100 MW Solar Farm: Harnesses solar energy to generate electricity
- 50 MW Battery Storage: Provides backup power and supports energy stability
- Site Development: Includes access roads and site facilities

**Project Scope**<br />
The project covers the design, approvals, and construction phases, with a focus on sustainability and compliance with local environmental standards.

**Timeline**<br />
The estimated timeline for the project is approximately 137 weeks, including design, construction, and validation phases.

**Budget**<br />
The estimated budget is between AUD 100-127.5 million, covering all phases from planning to construction and validation.

**Stakeholders**<br />
Key stakeholders include government bodies, local councils, environmental groups, and the local community.

**ESG Considerations**<br />
The project prioritizes environmental sustainability, following ISO standards for environmental management and social responsibility.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:
- Renewable Energy System Design: Understanding the key components of solar PV farms and battery storage systems
- Project Planning and Management: Developing timelines, managing budgets, and stakeholder engagement
- Environmental Considerations: Applying ISO standards to ensure sustainability and compliance with environmental regulations
